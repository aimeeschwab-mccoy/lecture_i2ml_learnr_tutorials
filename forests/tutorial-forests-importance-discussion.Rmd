## Variable Importance and Discussion


### Study Goals

*Theoretical (T)*

- Learn what variable/feature importance is and how to compute it
- Understand the pros and cons of random forests




### Preparation

1.  *(T)* Watch the following videos (sorry, rather low volume...):

### Exercises

#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r forest-quiz-vid, echo=FALSE}
question("Which statements are true?",
    answer("To compute permutation variable importance for feature j, we permute the feature and see how the performance changes (in OOB observations).", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The higher the variable importance, the more important the variable is for the model/ the prediction.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The random forest is a bad out of the box model and requires tuning of hyperparameters."),
  answer("Random forests and trees can be used for high-dimensional data.", correct = TRUE)
)
```
