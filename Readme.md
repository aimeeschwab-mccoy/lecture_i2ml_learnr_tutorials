# Introduction to Machine Learning - Interactive Tutorials

This repository contains the [`learnr`](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/index.html) tutorials for the lecture ["Introduction to machine learning"](https://github.com/compstat-lmu/lecture_i2ml).

Each day is treated interactively in form of a Shiny App.

## Run Locally

To run a tutorial locally the only thing you have to do is to run `rmarkdown::run("tutorial.Rmd")` of the specific day. For instance, to run day 1 you just have to call:
```r
rmarkdown::run("01-intro/01_tutorial.Rmd")
```

## Run on shinyapps.io
