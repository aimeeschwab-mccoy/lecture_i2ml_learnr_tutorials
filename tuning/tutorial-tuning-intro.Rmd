#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r tuning-quiz-intro, echo=FALSE}
question("Which statements are true?",
  answer("Tuning means optimizing hyperparameters.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Doing tuning well is hard; nested resampling can help.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Good tuning is crucial to achieve good performance for all ML algorithms."),
  # answer("Parallelization is trivial for tuning.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Tuning optimizes the inner loss.")
  # answer("How well tuning works depends on the learner and the impact of the hyperparameters on that learner.", correct = TRUE),
  # answer("Grid search often works better than random search."),
  # answer("Grid search scales exponentially with the dimension of the parameter space.", correct = TRUE),
  # answer("Grid search evaluates many points from the parameter space that aren't of interest.", correct = TRUE),
  # answer("Random search works often better due to it's better exploration of the hyperparameter space.", correct = TRUE),
  # answer("Random search scales very well with the dimension of the hyperparameter space."),
  # answer("Random search as well as grid search has the problem of discretization.")
)
