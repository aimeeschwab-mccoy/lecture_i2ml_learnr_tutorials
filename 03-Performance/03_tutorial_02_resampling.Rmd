## Resampling

### Study Goals

*Theoretical (T)*

- Know the goals and the idea of resampling
- Get familiar with Cross-Validation, Bootstrap and Subsampling

### Preparation

1.  *(T)* Watch the following video  (sorry, rather low volume...):

### Exercises

#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r resampling-quiz, echo=FALSE}
  question("Which statements are true?",
    answer("The method of resampling is a nonparametric method of statistical inference.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Subsampling is basically a repeated holdout and is also very similar to
           bootstrapping, so subsampling is done with replacement."),
    answer("Estimating the expected generalization error is a goal of resampling.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("In Resampling, the data set is split repeatedly into training and tests
          sets.", correct = TRUE)

  )
```
