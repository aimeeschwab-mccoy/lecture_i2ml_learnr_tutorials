**Exercises**

```{r loss-quiz, echo=FALSE}
question("What statements are true?",
  answer("Every model can have an arbitrary loss function"),
  answer("The empirical risk $\\mathcal{R}_\\text{emp}$ is induced by the loss", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The loss/empirical risk corresponds to the evaluation part of the learner (inducer)", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The absolute loss is more sensitive in terms of outliers"),
  answer("The optimization of a learner highly depends on the properties of the loss function", correct = TRUE)
)
