#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r basics-quiz, echo=FALSE}
question("Which statements are true?",
    answer("Machine learning is a branch of statistics and computer science.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("A model $f$  is a mapping from the feature space to the target space.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The goal of an ML algorithm is to yield a model that reproduces the already seen data as accurately as possible."),
    answer("ML algorithms try to predict the target variable as accurately as possible based on the values of the features.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Supervised learning tasks are prediction problems.",
        correct = TRUE),
    answer("Unsupervised learning tries to discover structure and patterns in
           the training data.",
        correct = TRUE)
)
