### Exercises

#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r riskminimization-quiz, echo=FALSE}

question("Which statements are true?",
    answer("Measures for model performance can be used as loss functions.",
        correct = TRUE),
    answer("The choice of loss function has no influence on the model."),
    answer("The empirical risk is the mean loss.", correct = TRUE), 
    answer("To estimate model paramters, we usually minimize the empirical risk.",
        correct = TRUE),
    answer("By minimizing the empirical risk, we minimize the error (defined by the loss).",
        correct = TRUE),
    answer("Any model can use any arbitrary loss function."),
    answer("Empirical risk minimization is a very general mathematical framework
         that turns 'finding a good model' into a mathematically tractable
         optimization problem.",
        correct = TRUE),
    answer("Since empirical risk minimization is a completely abstract and very
         general mathematical procedure, the choice of loss function should not
         depend on background knowledge about the data set at hand or what the
         model is going to be used for."),
    answer("How difficult the optimization of a learner is depends strongly on the
         properties of its loss function.",
        correct = TRUE)
)
