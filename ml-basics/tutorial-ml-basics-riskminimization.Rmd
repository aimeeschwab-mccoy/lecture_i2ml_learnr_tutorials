### Study Goals

*Theoretical (T)*

- Understand the role of risk minimization for machine learning
- Understand what a loss function is

### Preparation

1.  *(T)* Watch the following video:

### Exercises

#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r riskminimization-quiz, echo=FALSE}

question("Which statements are true?",
    answer("Measures for model performance can be used as loss functions.",
        correct = TRUE),
    answer("The choice of loss function has no influence on the model."),
    answer("The empirical risk is the mean loss.", correct = TRUE), 
    answer("To estimate model paramters, we usually minimize the empirical risk.",
        correct = TRUE),
    answer("By minimizing the empirical risk, we minimize the error (defined by the loss).",
        correct = TRUE),
    answer("With machine learning we can get a good prediction, regardless of our domain knowledge on the field of research.")
)
