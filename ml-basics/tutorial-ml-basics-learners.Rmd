## Models and Learners

### Study Goals

*Theoretical (T)*

- Be able do differentiate between regression and classification tasks

*Practical (P)*

- Get to know how to create tasks in `mlr`

### Preparation

1.  *(T)* Watch the following video:

    ![Models & Learners](https://youtu.be/UW1E4xO0hJQ){width="75%"}
    </center>


1.  *(P)* Read the [`mlr` tutorial about tasks](https://mlr.mlr-org.com/articles/tutorial/task.html).

### Exercises

#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r learners-quiz, echo=FALSE}
# quiz(caption = "Tasks",
  question("Which statements are true?",
    answer("Supervised learning tasks are prediction problems.",
           correct = TRUE),
    answer("Unsupervised learning tries to discover structure and patterns in
           the training data.",
           correct = TRUE),
    answer("Every unsupervised task is internally treated as supervised task."),
    answer("Unsupervised learning is learning without a target variable.",
           correct = TRUE),
    answer("Classification is a supervised learning task.",
           correct = TRUE),
    answer("Regression is a supervised learning task.",
           correct = TRUE),
    answer("Clustering is a supervised learning task.")
  )
```

#### *(P)* Creating learner with `mlr`

For this exercise, take a look at the [`iris` dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set):

```{r}
