### Exercises

#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r tree-quiz1, echo=FALSE}
  question("Which statements about CART are true?",
    answer("For each node, one iterates over all features, and for each feature over all split points.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Entropy and Gini index are more sensitive to changes in the node probabilities.",correct = TRUE),
    answer("For metric features the exact split points is always ambiguous.")
)
```
