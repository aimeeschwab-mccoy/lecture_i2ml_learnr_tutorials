    answer("Often works well enough.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("It can work also on high-dimensional data.",correct = TRUE),
    answer("Proximities are used in replacing missing data, but not locating outliers."),
    answer("For each variable, this improvement is accumulated over all trees for the importance measure.",correct = TRUE)
