## Performance Intro and Simple Metrics

### Study Goals

*Theoretical (T)*

- Learn what performance estimation is and why it is important
- Get familiar with simple performance measures for regression and classification

### Preparation

1.  *(T)* Watch the following videos (sorry, rather low volume...):

### Exercises

#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r performance-quiz, echo=FALSE}
# quiz(caption = "Basic Terminology",
  question("Which statements are true?",
    answer("We want to know, how the model performs on new unseen data.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("In logistic regression we minimize the binomial loss and in kNN there is no explicit loss minimization.",correct = TRUE),
    answer("Goodness-of-fit measures like $R^2$, likelihood, AIC, BIC, deviance are all based on the test error"),
    answer("All outer losses can also be used as inner loss."),
    answer("The MSE is also used in the linear model to find the best parameter estimator.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Assuming a linear model without intercept, then it is possible that the $R^2$ is smaller than 0 or greater than 1.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The brier score covers how well the predicted probabilities are calibrated.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The log-loss can be calculated by assuming that the target variable is normally distributed."),
    answer("The accuracy and mean classification error are calculated using the predicted probabilities.")
)
