## Performance Intro and Simple Metrics

### Study Goals

*Theoretical (T)*

- Learn what performance estimation is and why it is important
- Get familiar with simple performance measures for regression and classification

### Preparation

1.  *(T)* Watch the following videos (sorry, rather low volume...):

### Exercises

#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r performance-quiz, echo=FALSE}
# quiz(caption = "Basic Terminology",
  question("Which statements are true?",
    answer("We want to know how accurately a fitted model will predict target variable values in new, previously unseen data.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Logistic regression minimizes the binomial loss.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("There is no explicit loss minimization in kNN for classification.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Goodness-of-fit measures like $R^2$, likelihood, AIC, BIC and deviance are all based on the test error"),
    answer("All outer losses can also be used as inner loss."),
    answer("The MSE is used in the conventional linear model to find the best parameter estimates.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("$R^2$ can be smaller than 0 or greater than 1 in a linear model without intercept.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The Brier score also quantifies how well the predicted probabilities are calibrated.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The log-loss can be calculated by assuming that the target variable is normally distributed."),
    answer("Accuracy and mean classification error are calculated using the predicted probabilities.")
)
