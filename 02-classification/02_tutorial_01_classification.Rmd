## Introduction

### Study Goals

- Learn what a classifier is
- Difference between linear and non-linear classifiers
- Generative vs. discriminative approach

### Exercises

#### Quiz

```{r basics-quiz, echo=FALSE}
question("Which statements are true?",
  answer("Classification is part of supervised learning.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The decision boundary is independent of the used model."),
  answer("Binary classification uses two discriminant functions."),
  answer("Linear classifiers can just learn linear decision boundaries."),
  answer("The generative and discriminant approach are basically the same."),
  answer("The generative approach is a probabilistic approach.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The linear discriminant analysis is a discriminant approach."),
  answer("For the discriminant approach we must have a loss function for minimization.", correct = TRUE)
)
```
