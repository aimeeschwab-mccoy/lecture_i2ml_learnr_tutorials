## Introduction to Classification

**Study Goals**

- Learn how classification works.
- Know the differences of generative approach and discriminant approach
- or ?????????
- Know the basic ideas of generative approach and discriminant approach

**Exercises**

```{r basics-quiz, echo=FALSE}
# quiz(caption = "Basic Terminology",
  question("Which statements are true?",
    answer("A model $f$  is a mapping from the feature space $\\mathcal{X}$ to the target space $\\mathcal{Y}$.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The goal of an ML algorithm is to yield a model that reproduces the already seen data as accurately as possible."),
    answer("ML algorithms try to predict the target variable as accurately as possible based on the values of the features.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("For a given hypothesis class $H$, different optimization procedures can be used to find the best model $f \\in H$.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Providing two different training data sets to a learner will result in the same optimal model $f$."),
    answer("The *representation* of a learner defines its hypothesis class $H$.", correct = TRUE)
  )
```

```{r basics-quiz2, echo=FALSE}
# quiz(caption = "Basic Terminology",
  question("Which statements are true?",
    answer(" The discriminant approach assumes a data generating process, in which the x have different distributions, depending on the class. The generative approach attempts to minimize a loss function."),
    answer("Linear discriminant analysis is a discriminant approach, while Quadratic discriminant analysis is not."),
    answer("The discriminant approach tries to model the discriminant score function directly.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Logistic regression is a discriminant approach", correct = TRUE)
  )
```
