## Introduction to Classification

### Study Goals

*Theoretical (T)*

- Understand the structure of classification problems
- Understand the difference between linear and non-linear classifiers

### Preparation

1.  *(T)* Watch the following video  (sorry, rather low volume...):

### Exercises

#### *(T)* Quiz


```{r classi-quiz1, echo=FALSE}
quiz(caption = "",
  question("Which statements are true?",
    answer("Classification is part of supervised learning.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The decision boundary is independent of the used model."),
    answer("Binary classification uses two discriminant functions."),
    answer("Linear classifiers can just learn linear decision boundaries."),
    answer("For the discriminant approach we must have a loss function for minimization.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The generative and discriminant approach are basically the same."),
    answer("The generative approach is a probabilistic approach.", correct = TRUE)
  ),
  question("Which statements are false?",
    answer("The discriminant approach assumes a data generating process in which the features have different distributions conditional on the class of the target variable.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The generative approach attempts to minimize a loss function.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Linear discriminant analysis is a discriminant approach, while quadratic discriminant analysis is not.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The discriminant approach tries to model the discriminant score function directly."),
    answer("Logistic regression is a discriminant approach")
  )
)
