## Logistic Regression

**Study Goals**

- Know how logistic regression works
- Understand the ideas of two approaches, which can make logistic regressions
- Know the extension of logistic regression

**Preparation**

1.  Watch the following video  (sorry, rather low volume...):

**Exercises**

```{r basics-quiz1, echo=FALSE}
# quiz(caption = "Basic Terminology",
  question("Which statements are true?",
    answer("Logistic regression is usually fitted by maximum likelihood with numerical optimization or it can be solved analytically."),
    answer("softmax is a generalization of the logistic function.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("In Logistic regression, the estimator $\\theta$ by optimizing maximum likelihood is identical to the one by minimizing the empirical risk.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("In a softmax, a numerical trick for avoiding overparameterized is to set $\\theta_{g} = 0$ and only optimize the other $\\theta_{k}$ ($k\\neq g$).", correct = TRUE)
  )
```
