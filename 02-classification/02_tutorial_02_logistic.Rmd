## Tasks

**Study Goals**

- Know how logistic regressions works
- Understand the idea of two approach, which can make logistic regressions.
- Know the extension of logistic regression

**Preparation**

1.  Watch the following video  (sorry, rather low volume...):

    </center>

1.  Read the [`mlr` tutorial about tasks](https://mlr.mlr-org.com/articles/tutorial/task.html).

**Exercises**

```{r tasks-quiz, echo=FALSE}
# quiz(caption = "Tasks",
  question("Which statements are true?",
    answer("Supervised learning tasks are prediction problems.",
           correct = TRUE),
    answer("Unsupervised learning tries to discover structure and patterns in
           the training data.",
           correct = TRUE),
    answer("Every unsupervised task is internally treated as supervised task."),
    answer("Unsupervised learning is learning without a target variable.",
           correct = TRUE),
    answer("Classification is a supervised leaning task.",
           correct = TRUE),
    answer("Regression is a supervised learning task.",
           correct = TRUE),
    answer("Clustering is a supervised learning task.")
  )
```

### Creating tasks with `mlr`

For this exercise, take a look at the [`iris` dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set):

```{r}
summary(iris)
```

1.  Define a new classification task based on the iris dataset with target variable `Species` and just two features `Sepal.Width` and `Petal.Width`:

```{r iristask, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=5, exercise.checker=createChecker("iris_task")}
iris_task =
```

```{r iristask-hint-1}
# Use the 'makeClassifTask' function of mlr
makeClassifTask(...)
```

```{r iristask-hint-2}
# Select just the three columns Sepal.Width, Petal.Width, and Species
iris[, c("Species", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Width")]
```

```{r iristask-hint-3}
# The target variable has to be specified as character of length 1
"Species"
```

```{r iristask-solution}
makeClassifTask(data = iris[, c("Species", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Width")], target = "Species")
```

```{r iristask-check}
iris_task = makeClassifTask(data = iris[, c("Species", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Width")], target = "Species")
```
