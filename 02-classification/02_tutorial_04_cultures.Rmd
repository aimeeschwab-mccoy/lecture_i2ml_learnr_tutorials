## The Two Cultures of Statistical

### Study Goals

*Theoretical (T)*
  
- Learn how to get a model with the data modeling culture or the algorithmic modeling culture
- Interpretability vs predictive accuracy
- Goodness of model

### Preparation

1.  *(T)* Watch the following video  (sorry, rather low volume...):

### Exercises
  
#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r Two Cultures of Statistical-quiz, echo=FALSE}
question("Which statements are true?",
  answer("The data modeling culture can lead to irrelevant theory and questionable statistical conclusions.", 
         correct = TRUE),
  answer("In the algorithmic modeling culture, the true mechanism is treated as unknown, while the data modeling                 culture tries to find the true data-generating mechanism.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The models that are good in prediction are always complex."),
  answer("Decision trees (random forest) has an excellent prediction accuracy, but it is impossible to interpret the model structure.", correct = TRUE)
)
```
