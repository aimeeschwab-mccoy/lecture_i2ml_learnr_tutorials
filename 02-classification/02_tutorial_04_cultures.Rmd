```{r Two Cultures of Statistical-quiz, echo=FALSE}
question("Which statements are true?",
  answer(" The data modeling culture can lead to irrelevant theory and questionable statistical conclusions.", 
         correct = TRUE),
  answer("In the algorithmic modeling culture, the true mechanism is treated as unknown, while the data modeling                 culture tries to find the true data-generating mechanism.", correct = TRUE),
  answer(" the models that are good in prediction are always complex."),
  answer(" decision trees (random forest) has an excellent prediction accuracy, but it is impossible to interpret the model structure.", correct = TRUE)
)
```
