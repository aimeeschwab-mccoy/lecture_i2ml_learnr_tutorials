## The Two Cultures of Statistical

### Study Goals

*Theoretical (T)*
  
- Appreciate the different approaches of the data modeling culture and the algorithmic modeling culture
- Understand the trade-off betwen interpretability and predictive accuracy
- Understand the problems of model evaluation and model choice

### Preparation

1.  *(T)* Watch the following video  (sorry, rather low volume...):

### Exercises
  
#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r Two Cultures of Statistical-quiz, echo=FALSE}
question("Which statements are true?",
  answer("The data modeling culture can lead to irrelevant theory and questionable statistical conclusions.", 
         correct = TRUE),
  answer("In the algorithmic modeling culture, the true data-generating process is treated as unknown and irrelevant, while the data modeling culture assumes the true data-generating mechanism can be estimated.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Models with good predictive performance are always complex."),
  answer("Random forests often have excellent prediction accuracy, but are impossible to interpret.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Data-modeling culture is obsolete because methods developed in the algorithmic modeling culture often perform better."),
  answer("In the algorithmic modeling culture, much effort is spent on how to improve the generalizability of the model for new data.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("In the data modeling culture, much effort is spent on how to correctly model the true unknown data-generating process.", correct = TRUE)
)
```
