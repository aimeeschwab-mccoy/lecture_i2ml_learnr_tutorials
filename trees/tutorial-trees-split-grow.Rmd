### Exercises

#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r tree-quiz-sg, echo=FALSE}
question("Which statements about CART are true?",
  answer("To find optimal splits, one iterates over all features, and for each feature over all possible split points.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("To find optimal splits, we use the one that splits the data approximately in half in each step."),
  answer("To find optimal splits, we evaluate the possible splits only on the data that ended up in the parent node we are trying to split.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The optimal split results in the lowest sum of empirical risks in the child nodes.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Monotone transformations of several features will change the structure of the tree."),
  answer("The CART algorithm cannot go on training if every node contains exactly one observation", correct = TRUE)
)
```
