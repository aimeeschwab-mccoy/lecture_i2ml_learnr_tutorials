### Exercises

#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r randomforest-quiz2, echo=FALSE}
  question("Which statements are true?",
    answer("The choice of model depends on the problem structure.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("In real data sets, missing values are not common."),
    answer("For good prediction on tabular data, tree ensembles like \textbf{Random Forest} and \textbf{xgboost} (boosted tree stumps) work generally well.",correct = TRUE),
    answer("If only a small portion of the data contains missing values and the values are MCAR, these observations can be omitted.",correct = TRUE)
)
```
