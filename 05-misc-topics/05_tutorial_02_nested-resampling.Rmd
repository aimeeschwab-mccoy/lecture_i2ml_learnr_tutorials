### Exercises

#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r tree-quiz2, echo=FALSE}
  question("Which statements about nested resampling are true?",
    answer("The result is based on pure randomness.",correct = TRUE),
    answer("Danger of overfitting to the resampling splits / overtuning!",correct = TRUE),
    answer("The final performance estimate will not be optimistically biased.")
)
```
