## Tuning

### Study Goals

*Theoretical (T)*

- Why tuning is important
- Get familiar with tuning


### Preparation

### Exercises

#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r random forest-quiz1, echo=FALSE}
  question("Which statements are true?",
    answer("Tuning means optimizing hyperparameters.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Doing tuning well is hard, nested resampling can help.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Good tuning is crucial to achieve good performance for all ML algorithms."),
    answer("Parallelization is trivial for tuning.", correct = TRUE)
    
    
)
```
