## Introduction

### Study Goals

*Theoretical (T)*

- Get an idea of what classification means
- Understand the structure of classification problems
- Understand the difference between classifiers producing labels, probabilities and scores
- Understand the two fundamental approaches: generative and discriminant
- Learn about linear classifiers as a subclass of classification models

### Exercises

#### *(T)* Quiz


```{r classi-quiz1, echo=FALSE}
question("Which statements are true?",
    answer("Classification is part of supervised learning.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Scoring classifiers output numbers between 0 and 1"),
    answer("Probabilistic classifiers output numbers between 0 and 1", correct = TRUE),
    answer("With scoring classifiers one can obtain class labels by using a threshold", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The decision boundary is independent of the used model."),
    answer("For the discriminant approach we must have a loss function for minimization.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The generative and discriminant approach are basically the same."),
    answer("The generative approach is a probabilistic approach.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Binary classification uses two discriminant functions."),
    answer("Linear classifiers can just learn linear decision boundaries."),
    answer("Logistic regression is an example for the discriminant approach.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Linear classifiers specify the discriminant function with linear functions.", correct = TRUE)
)
